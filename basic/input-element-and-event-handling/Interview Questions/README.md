1. What are events in JavaScript?
2. How many HTML 5 Standard Events are there?

### Answer

1. JavaScript's interaction with HTML is handled through events that occur when the user or the browser manipulates a page. When the page loads, it is called an event. When the user clicks a button, that click too is an event. Other examples include events like pressing any key, closing a window, resizing a window, etc.

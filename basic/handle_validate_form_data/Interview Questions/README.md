### Answer

1. Form validation is a “technical process where a web-form checks if the information provided by a user is correct.” The form will either alert the user that they messed up and need to fix something to proceed, or the form will be validated and the user will be able to continue with their registration process.
2. Increase the interactivity and usability of the web page. Make the web page more user-friendly by providing easy to use and rich features. Saves server traffic by validating user input before sending to the server. Respond immediately if there is any mistake in user data without waiting for the page reload
3. The guidelines on general principles of process validation mentions four types of validation:
   A) Prospective validation (or premarket validation)
   B) Retrospective validation.
   C) Concurrent validation.
   D) Revalidation.
   A) Prospective validation.
4. Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; by catching invalid data on the client-side, the user can fix it straight away.

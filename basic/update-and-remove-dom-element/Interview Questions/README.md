5. What is innerText and innerHtml?

### Answer

1. The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for HTML and XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated.
2. DOM manipulation is interacting with the DOM API to change/modify the HTML document that is to be rendered on the web browser. This HTML document can be changed/modified to add elements, remove elements, edit elements, move elements around, etc.

3. The DOMParser interface provides the ability to parse XML or HTML source code from a string into a DOM Document . You can perform the opposite operation—converting a DOM tree into XML or HTML source—using the XMLSerializer interface

4. A node is any DOM object. An element is one specific type of node.
5. innerText returns all text contained by an element and all its child elements. innerHtml returns all text, including html tags, that is contained by an element.
